# Puzzle Alchemy Back End

  We set out to create a simple puzzle web-application where users would be able to connect, register, log-in, upload, share, and complete puzzles. Puzzles are constructed from user submitted photos, and photos must be approved by admins before they are publicly available as puzzle images. If a user does not want their photo to be publicly available, they can specify that choice as well.

## Technologies Used

   Java - 1.8
   Spring Boot & Data
   PostgreSQL
   AWS: S3, RDS and EC2


## Features

### Users can:
   - Register, Log In, Reset Password
   - Edit User Profile
   - Solve puzzles on the public menu
   - Upload and save their own photos for custom puzzles
   - Share their photos in the public menu
    
### Admins can:
   - Create, Edit or Delete Users
   - Approve or Deny puzzles submitted for public access

### To-do list:
   - Add the ability to customize the user profile photo
   - Make the puzzles more complex

## Usage
  
   This is the backend application, and will need to be used in conjunction with the front end application.  (Repo here: https://github.com/sfunk11/alchemy-front-end )
